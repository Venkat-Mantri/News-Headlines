# News-Headlines
Project Description

This repository contains a Python-based web scraper that automatically collects top news headlines from a public news website. It leverages the requests library to fetch HTML content and BeautifulSoup for parsing and extracting headline elements (e.g., <h2>, <h3> tags). Extracted headlines are saved to a .txt file for easy access and future reference. The project demonstrates practical skills in web scraping, HTTP communication, and data handling using Python, and serves as a foundational tool for news aggregation, content monitoring, or text analysis.
